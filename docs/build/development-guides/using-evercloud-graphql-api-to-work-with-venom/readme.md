# Using Evercloud GraphQL API to work with Venom

This section contains guides on the various ways to access the Venom blockchain using the capabilities of Evercloud GraphQL API.

## What is Evercloud

Evercloud is a highhly available cloud solution that provides TVM-compatible networks, including Venom, with GraphQl API endpoints. 

With Evercloud, you don't need to run your own node to access the blockchain. It shares the API with supernode and [local node for testing](https://github.com/tonlabs/evernode-se), providing all the necessary capabilities. As a result, projects can be easily migrated between the local node, Evercloud, and supernode.

Evercloud has been designed with both community-driven development and high-load enterprise DApps in mind.

## What you can do with GraphQL API

You can use the GraphQL API to query various kinds of blockchain data and send messages to the blockchain.

To get a general idea of how the API works in different environments, start with the [Quick Start on Venom Blockchain](graphql-quick-start.md) guide.

For more specific guidance on implementing your use case with the help of the GraphQL API, consult the [Specialized Guides](graphql-api-guides.md).

Full Evercloud and GraphQL API documentation is available at https://docs.evercloud.dev/reference/graphql-api.
